We are the University of Sheffield’s roleplaying society – these friendly people keep things running:

<ul>
  <li>President: Nat Wright</li>
  <li>Secretary: Rebecca Campbell</li>
  <li>Treasurer: Adam Stringer</li>
  <li>Inclusions: Georgia Berry</li>
  <li>Social Secretary: Rob O’Brien</li>

</ul>

If you have questions, problems or ideas – these people are the ones to ask. You can contact us on [Facebook via the group page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/173390986083361/), or by [email](mailto:noddsoc@sheffield.ac.uk). You can also come along to our committee meetings, usually on Wednesday’s at 6pm every month, in the gallery of the Student’s Union (same place NoDDSoc normally meets).
